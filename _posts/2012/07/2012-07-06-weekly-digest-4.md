[INotifyPropertyChanged Implementation for VS2012,Kathleen Dollard:](http://msmvps.com/blogs/kathleen/archive/2012/06/30/inotifypropertychanged-implementation-for-vs2012.aspx) I told some folks at the East Tennessee .NET UG (ETNUG, which was adorably put on the reservation board at the after meeting bar as “Eatnug”) meeting in Knoxville that I would post info on a .NET 4.5 version of INotifyPropertyChanged that used CallerMemberName.
