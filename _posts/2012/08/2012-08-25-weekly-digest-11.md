[Using JSHint inside Visual Studio – the basics, Steven Sanderson:](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/17/using-jshint-inside-visual-studio-the-basics/) JSHint is great. It’s a linting tool for JavaScript: a simple tool that can very often spot your mistakes before you do. It can save you from a lot of tedious debugging, lets you refactor JavaScript code with greater confidence, and reduces the chances of you deploying broken code to your production server.

[Entities, Models, and Architecture, Chris Eargle:](http://www.kodefuguru.com/post/2012/08/17/Entities-Models-and-Architecture.aspx) I read several programming articles a day to expose myself to other’s ideas and maybe find a gem or two. I share the articles I find interesting, but I don’t always agree with everything the author has written. One of these articles caused quite a bit of controversy when I posted it to my Facebook, probably because I have a lot of DBA friends and the title was Why I Avoid Stored Procedures (And You Should Too).

[An Introduction to ASP.NET Web API, Rick Strahl:](http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2012/Aug/21/An-Introduction-to-ASPNET-Web-API) Microsoft recently released ASP.NET MVC 4.0 and .NET 4.5 and along with it, the brand spanking new ASP.NET Web API. Web API is an exciting new addition to the ASP.NET stack that provides a new, well-designed HTTP framework for creating REST and AJAX APIs (API is Microsoft’s new jargon for a service, in case you’re wondering). Although Web API ships and installs with ASP.NET MVC 4, you can use Web API functionality in any ASP.NET project, including WebForms, WebPages and MVC or just a Web API by itself. And you can also self-host Web API in your own applications from Console, Desktop or Service applications.
