Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or to store application data privately.

Common uses of Blob storage include:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser

* Storing files for distributed access

* Streaming video and audio

* Performing secure backup and disaster recovery

* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

I have unit test driven repository on Github to show common uses of Blob storage.
