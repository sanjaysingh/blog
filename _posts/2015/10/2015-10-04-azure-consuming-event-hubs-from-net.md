Event Hubs is a service that processes large amounts of event data from connected devices and applications. After you collect data into Event Hubs, you can store the data using a storage cluster or transform it using a real-time analytics provider. This large scale event collection and processing capability is a key component of modern application architectures including the Internet of Things (IoT).

I have unit test driven repository on Github to show common uses of Blob storage.
