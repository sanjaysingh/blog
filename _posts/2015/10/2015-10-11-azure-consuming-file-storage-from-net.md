Azure File storage offers file shares in the cloud using the standard SMB protocol. File storage supports both SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.0.Because file shares are SMB shares, you can access them via standard and familiar file system APIs.

I have unit test driven repository on Github to show common uses of File storage.
