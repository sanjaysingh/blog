I've developed: a [browser-based Ethereum wallet](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/ethwallet/) specifically designed for testing purposes. While there are many Ethereum wallets available, I created this one with a specific focus on ease of access by making it accessible directly from the browser.

## Why Another Ethereum Wallet?

During blockchain development and testing, I often found myself needing a lightweight wallet that:
- Works directly in the browser without installation
- Supports multiple networks (including testnets)
- Doesn't store any sensitive data
- No server side and connects directly with RPC that you specify
- Is completely transparent in its operations

## Security-First Design

The wallet is built with several security principles in mind:

1. **No Server-Side Storage**: All wallet operations happen entirely in your browser
2. **No External Dependencies**: The wallet runs as a static site with minimal dependencies
3. **Transparent Code**: The entire [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/sanjaysingh/staticsites/tree/master/ethwallet)
4. **Ephemeral Storage**: Keys are never saved between sessions

## Key Features

The wallet includes essential features needed for testing:

- **Custom RPC Endpoint Support**: Connect to any Ethereum-compatible network
- **Seed Phrase/Private Key Import**: Easily import test accounts
- **New Wallet Generation**: Generate fresh wallets for testing
- **Native Token Support**: Send and receive network native tokens
- **ERC20 Token Support**: Interact with token contracts
- **Gas Estimation**: Built-in gas cost estimation with safety buffer
- **Balance Checking**: Real-time balance updates

## How to Use

1. Visit [https://static.sanjaysingh.net/ethwallet/](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/ethwallet/)
2. Enter your RPC endpoint 
3. Either:
   - Generate a new wallet for testing
   - Import an existing wallet using seed phrase or private key
4. Start interacting with the blockchain

## Important Security Notes

While the wallet is designed with security in mind, please note:

⚠️ **This is a TESTING tool only. Do not use it with real funds.**

- Always use test accounts and test networks
- Never enter production private keys or seed phrases
- The wallet is intended for development and testing purposes only

## Use Cases

This wallet is particularly useful for:

1. **Developers**:
   - Testing smart contracts
   - Debugging transactions
   - Quick network interactions

2. **QA Teams**:
   - Validating blockchain applications
   - Testing different network configurations
   - Verifying transaction flows

3. **Learning**:
   - Understanding wallet operations
   - Exploring blockchain interactions
   - Studying Web3 development
