Today, I'm sharing a simple yet effective tool I've developed: a [browser-based QR Code Generator](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/qrcode/). In an era where QR codes have become ubiquitous, having a quick, reliable, and privacy-focused way to generate them is essential.

## Why Another QR Code Generator?

While there are numerous QR code generators available online, I wanted to create one that is:
- Completely client-side with no server dependencies
- Privacy-focused (no data collection or tracking)
- Lightning fast and responsive
- Simple and straightforward to use
- Free from ads and distractions

## Features

The tool offers essential QR code generation capabilities:

1. **Text/URL Input**: Generate QR codes for any text or URL
2. **Customizable Size**: Adjust the QR code size to your needs
3. **Instant Generation**: See QR codes generated in real-time
4. **Download Option**: Save generated QR codes as PNG images
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

The interface is intentionally minimalist:

1. Visit [https://static.sanjaysingh.net/qrcode/](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/qrcode/)
2. Enter your text or URL in the input field
3. Adjust the size if needed (default size works for most cases)
4. Click "Generate QR Code"
5. Use "Download QR Code" to save the image

## Technical Implementation

The tool is built with simplicity and performance in mind:

```javascript
// Core technologies used:
- Pure HTML5 and JavaScript
- QRCode.js library for QR generation
- CSS for minimal, clean styling
```

Key technical features:
- No external dependencies beyond the QR code library
- Completely static deployment
- No backend required
- Cross-browser compatible
- Mobile-responsive design

## Privacy and Security

Privacy was a key consideration in the design:

- **No Data Storage**: All QR code generation happens in your browser
- **No Analytics**: No tracking or usage monitoring
- **No External Calls**: Besides loading the page, no network requests are made
- **Open Source**: [Code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/sanjaysingh/staticsites/tree/master/qrcode) for review

## Use Cases

This tool is perfect for:

1. **Business Users**:

   - Creating quick links to social profiles
   - Generating contact information QR codes

3. **Developers**:

   - Creating QR codes for app testing

## Benefits

1. **Speed and Efficiency**:
   - Instant QR code generation
   - No page reloads needed
   - Quick download option

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Works on any device with a browser
   - No installation required
   - Simple, intuitive interface

3. **Privacy**:
