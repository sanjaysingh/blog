Hey everyone! I wanted to share a fun little project I've been tinkering with lately â€“ a completely browser-based Bitcoin wallet that doesn't need any servers to run. It's perfect for testing and learning about Bitcoin.

## Why I Built This

1. Runs right in your browser â€“ no downloads needed
2. Keeps your test keys private and never sends them anywhere
3. Lets you connect to any Bitcoin API you trust
4. Looks decent enough that it's not painful to use
5. Is totally open for anyone to inspect or improve

So that's exactly what I did! This is definitely NOT meant for your life savings (seriously, please don't use it for that), but it's perfect for playing around with small amounts or just learning how Bitcoin transactions work.

## What Can This Little Wallet Do?

### Your Keys Stay With You

The coolest part about this wallet:
- **Nothing gets saved to a server** â€“ your keys never leave your browser
- **You choose your Bitcoin API** â€“ don't trust mine? Use your own!
- **No tracking or analytics** â€“ I don't want to know what you're testing

### All the Basic Stuff You Need

For a test wallet, it does all the essential things:

1. **Create or Import Test Wallets**
   - Hit a button, get a fresh wallet
   - Already have a WIF key you want to test? Just paste it in
   - Peek at your private key when needed, or keep it hidden

2. **Send Some Test Bitcoin**
   - Send to any address (great for testing your other wallets)
   - Play with different fee settings to see how they work
   - See your test transaction status and follow it on a block explorer

3. **Receive Bitcoin**
   - Show someone your wallet address to receive funds
   - Scan the QR code with another wallet to test sending
   - Easy copy button for sharing your address

4. **Check Your Balance**
   - See your balance update in real-time
   - Hit refresh when you're impatient (we've all been there!)

### Switch Networks Easily

One thing I really wanted was flexibility:
- Flip between testnet (for free test coins) and mainnet
- Use Blockstream's API by default, or plug in your own
- Try different APIs to see how they perform


### Keeping It Safe-ish

Even though it's for testing, I added some basic safety features:
- Private keys are hidden by default (no accidental shoulder-surfing)
- Everything stays in your current browser session
- No server to get hacked (because there isn't one!)

## Final Thoughts
It's meant for learning and experimenting, not safeguarding your crypto fortune.
