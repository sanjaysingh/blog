Hey folks! I just wrapped up another little weekend project - a [browser-based Hash Generator](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/hash/). It's super lightweight and lets you generate all sorts of cryptographic hashes right in your browser. No servers, no fuss.

## Why I Built This

Look, there are probably a million hash generators out there, but most of them make me a bit uneasy. 

- Keeps everything in your browser (your data never leaves your device)
- Has a clean interface without all the clutter
- Supports the hash algorithms you'd actually use
- Shows results as you type

## What It Does

Nothing fancy, just the essentials:

1. **Multiple hash types** - MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and more
2. **Real-time hashing** - See results instantly as you type
3. **One-click copy** - Grab that hash with a single click
4. **Works on phones** - Because who's not on their phone these days?
5. **Completely private** - Your data stays with you

## How to Use It

Super simple:

1. Head over to [https://static.sanjaysingh.net/hash/](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/hash/)
2. Pick your hash algorithm 
3. Type or paste your text
4. Boom - there's your hash
5. Hit copy if you need it on your clipboard


## Privacy (Yes, Actually)

- **Nothing gets stored** - Everything happens in your browser's memory
- **No sneaky network calls** - The page loads and that's it
- **Code is open** - [Check GitHub](https://github.com/sanjaysingh/staticsites/tree/master/hash) if you don't believe me

## Give It a Try

Code's on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanjaysingh/staticsites/tree/master/hash) if you want to peek under the hood.

## Other Stuff I've Made

If you like this, I've built a few other browser tools:
- [QR Code Generator](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/qrcode/) for when you need a quick QR code
- [Bitcoin Wallet](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/btcwallet/) for crypto experiments
- [JWT Token Generator](https://static.sanjaysingh.net/jwt/) for the API folks
